A tool generating a selectable curses-based list of elements that has access to current ZSH session, i.e. has broad capabilities to work together with it. That's `n-list`. The files `n-cd`, `n-env`, `n-kill`, etc. are applications of the tool. Feature highlights include incremental searching, ANSI coloring, grepping and various integrations with ZSH.

This is an alternative approach to idea of visual shell, when compared to Midnight Commander. Here the command line is the main way the shell is used. From that mode of operation, user call tools that do not require mouse or typing, only navigating.

ZNT can be compared to IDEs, integrated development environments. Typically, when user searches for occurences of a symbol throughout the project, what IDE does is that it provides a list that can be navigated.

## Installation via plugin

Running the script `doc/generate_plugin` will create a single-file version of `ZNT`. It can be sourced from `.zshrc` or added to `oh-my-zsh` (create directory `plugins/zshnavigationtools` in your `$ZSH/custom` or `$ZSH_CUSTOM` directory and copy the plugin there). Don't forget about configuration files as described below.

## Installation

Copy (or link) all n-\* files to **/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/** (or **/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/**, check with `echo $fpath[1]`). You can also copy them somewhere else and add that location to your `$fpath`.

Then add a command to autoload them to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
    autoload n-list n-cd n-env n-kill n-panelize n-options n-aliases n-functions n-history n-preview
```

To avoid typing of the minus sign "-", a no-sign version can be symlinked (zsh code):

```zsh
cd /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/
for i in n-*; do sudo ln -s "$i" "n${i#n-}"; done
```

After making symlinks, add one other autoload line:

```zsh
    autoload nlist ncd nenv nkill npanelize noptions naliases nfunctions nhistory npreview

```

Don't forget to copy [configuration files](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-navigation-tools/tree/master/.config/znt). They should go to `~/.config/znt`. Moreover, `n-cd` works together with option `AUTO_PUSHD` and you should have:

```zsh
setopt AUTO_PUSHD
```

in `.zshrc` (also recommend `PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS`). Without this option, `n-cd` will just work as incremental searcher of directory bookmarks.

## Introduction

The tools are:

- `n-aliases` - browses aliases, delegates editing to `vared`
- `n-cd` - browses dirstack and bookmarked directories, allows to enter selected directory
- `n-env` - browses environment, delegates editing to `vared`
- `n-functions` - browses functions, delegates editing to `zed` or `vared`
- `n-history` - browses history, allows to edit and run commands from it
- `n-kill` - browses processes list, allows to send signal to selected process
- `n-options` - browses options, allows to toggle their state
- `n-panelize` - loads output of given command into the list for browsing
- `n-preview` - a demonstration of running two lists at the same time and of ANSI colors - syntax highlighted source browser

All tools support horizontal scroll with `<`,`>` or `{`,`}`. Other keys are:

- `[`,`]` - jump directory bookmarks in `n-cd` and typical signals in `n-kill`
- `/` - start incremental search
- `Ctrl-d`, `Ctrl-u` - half page up or down
- `Ctrl-p`, `Ctrl-n` - previous and next (also done with `vim`'s `j`,`k`)
- `Ctrl-l` - redraw of whole display
- `g`, `G` - beginning and end of the list
- `Ctrl-w` (in incremental search) - delete whole word

## Programming

The function `n-list` is used as follows:

```zsh
n-list {element1} [element2] ... [elementN]
```

This is all that is needed to be done to have the features like ANSI coloring, incremental search, horizontal scroll (grepping is done outside n-list, see the tools for how it can be done). To set up non-selectable entries add their
indexes into array `NLIST_NONSELECTABLE_ELEMENTS`:

```zsh
typeset -a NLIST_NONSELECTABLE_ELEMENTS
NLIST_NONSELECTABLE_ELEMENTS=( 1 )
```

Result is stored as `$reply[$REPLY]`. The returned array might be different from
input arguments as `n-list` can process them via incremental search. `$REPLY` is
the index in that possibly processed array. If `$REPLY` equals `-1` it means that no
selection have been made (user quit via 'q' key).
